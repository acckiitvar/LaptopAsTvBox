# LaptopAsTvBox

This is a small C# application made for automative changing current power scheme lid action.
It helps when you want to connect your laptop as a video source and close it's lid.
In normal situation this causes going to sleep (S3) or you previously need to change preferences manually.
This application detects changing displays count and if there are more then one applies
"do nothing" lid action.

P.S. C3 is not my primary programming language, so source code may be not optimum.
